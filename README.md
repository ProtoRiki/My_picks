# My own color theme 
## Inspired by PyCharm's latest UI update

One day I won't be able to use PyCharm for free, and I've recently had to use VSCode more often due to its speed when connecting to remote servers (PyCharm's remote extension is painfully slow at the moment). Hence, I might as well make a theme that conforms to my esoteric tastes. This extension is suited for Python, and I'll add in colors for other languages if I find myself using them often enough.
